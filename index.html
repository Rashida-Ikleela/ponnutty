<h1>HTML</h1>
<p>
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure web pages. It defines the content of a webpage by using elements called tags, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links. HTML provides the basic framework of a website, which is then styled with CSS and made interactive with JavaScript. It is easy to learn and is the foundation of all web development.

<h1>CSS</h1>
<p>
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to style and design web pages. While HTML provides the structure of a webpage, CSS controls how it looks — including colors, fonts, layouts, spacing, and responsiveness. It allows developers to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites by separating content from presentation. With CSS, the same style can be applied across multiple pages, making website design more efficient and consistent.

<H1>JAVA SCRIPT</H1>
<p>
Java is a popular, high-level programming language known for its versatility, security, and platform independence. It follows the principle of “write once, run anywhere”, meaning programs written in Java can run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java is widely used for building web applications, mobile apps (especially Android), desktop software, and enterprise-level systems. Its object-oriented approach makes it easier to organize and reuse code, which is why Java remains one of the most important and widely used programming languages in the world.
